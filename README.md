to install the developer environment:

* open any Js code editor and modify code/my-bot.js until its **fit for war!**

**Be sure to use these tips:**

* search for patters on [lifewiki site](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:Patterns)
* I have included a nice RLE to pixels routine to make it easier to import patterns from golly/lifeWiki (just copy and paste)
